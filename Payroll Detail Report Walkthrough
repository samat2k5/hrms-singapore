# Payroll Detail Report Walkthrough

I have implemented the "Payroll Detail Report" as requested. This report provides a comprehensive breakdown of all allowances and deductions for each employee, featuring an interactive drill-down interface.

## Changes Made

### Backend
- **Endpoint**: Added `GET /api/reports/payroll-detail/:year/:month` in [server/routes/reports.js](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/server/routes/reports.js).
- **Data**: The endpoint returns detailed payslip information, including transport, meal, and other allowances, overtime pay, bonuses, CPF (EE), SHG, and attendance penalties.

### Frontend
- **API Service**: Added [getPayrollDetail(year, month)](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/client/src/services/api.js#145-146) to [client/src/services/api.js](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/client/src/services/api.js).
- **Reports Page**:
    - Added a new tab: **📝 Payroll Detail**.
    - Implemented a table with **Drill-down functionality**.
    - Clicking on an employee row expands it to show a side-by-side comparison of **Earnings breakdown** and **Deductions breakdown**.
    - **PDF Export**: Fixed the PDF export to correctly include columns for Employee, ID, Basic, Allowances, Deductions, and Net Pay for the Payroll Detail report.

## Verification Results

### Backend Verification
The endpoint has been added and follows the same pattern as existing report endpoints. It correctly filters by entity, year, and month.

### UI Verification
- The "Payroll Detail" tab appears in the Reports page.
- The table correctly aggregates and displays Basic, Total Allowances, Total Deductions, and Net Pay.
- Clicking a row expands/collapses the detailed breakdown.
- Financial values are formatted using the system's currency formatter.
