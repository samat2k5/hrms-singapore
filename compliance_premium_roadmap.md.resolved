# Singapore Compliance: Premium Roadmap

To elevate the HRMS Singapore project to "best-in-class" status, we will implement the following advanced features based on IRAS and GovTech specifications.

## 1. IRAS Seamless Filing (SFFS) Integration

The project will move from "File Upload" to "Direct API Filing" using **AIS-API 2.0**.

### Technical Requirements
- **Format**: JSON-based (replacing older XML/CSV formats).
- **Gateway**: GovTech APEX (Gateway 2.0).
- **Auth**: OAuth 2.1 with CorpPass OIDC.
- **Revision API**: Automate amendments for past filing years.

### Feature Goals
- One-click "Authorize & Submit" button using Singpass/CorpPass.
- Real-time submission status tracking (Pending → Accepted → Rejected with Error).

---

## 2. One-Stop Payroll (OSP) Integration

Integrate with the [One-Stop Payroll](https://www.onestoppayroll.gov.sg/) initiative to unify diverse government submissions.

### Feature Goals
- Unified Dashboard: Submit **CPF (CPFB)**, **AIS (IRAS)**, and **OSD (MOM)** data through a single workflow.
- Standardized data mapping to OSP JSON/CSV specifications.

---

## 3. High-Tier Compliance Automation

Features that distinguish professional-grade systems from basic implementations:

### IR21 (Tax Clearance) Automation
- **Target**: Foreign employees departing Singapore.
- **Logic**: Automatically populate IR21 forms by consolidating the current year-to-date income and the previous two years' tax records.
- **Workflow**: Generate, preview, and API-submit IR21.

### "IRAS-Ready" Validation Engine
- **Pre-flight Checks**: Logic to detect errors *before* submission:
    - Invalid NRIC/FIN formats.
    - Missing compulsory fields for Specific Benefits (e.g., Housing, Car).
    - CPF cap violations (exceeding annual/monthly limits).
    - Nationality/Entry-date mismatches.

### NS Make-Up Pay (MUP) Tracking
- Automated tracking of ICT (In-Camp Training) dates.
- Export/API submission for MINDEF MUP claims for employees.

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Robust Internal Validation & IR21 UI
- Build the "Ready-to-File" validator.
- Expand IRAS Compliance page to support full IR21 drafting.

### Phase 2: Unified Government Export Centre
- Create the "One-Stop" export dashboard.
- Support OSP-compliant formats.

### Phase 3: SFFS & API Integration
- Implement the APEX authentication flow stubs.
- AIS-API 2.0 JSON generator.
