# Walkthrough: Premium Singapore Compliance (Phase 1)

We have successfully implemented and verified the first phase of the **Premium Singapore Compliance** suite. This elevates the HRMS from a record-keeping system to an intelligent, filing-ready platform.

## 🏛️ New Premium Features

### 1. Intelligent Pre-Submission Validation
- **Usage**: Click the **🔍 Validate All** button in the IRAS Compliance Centre.
- **Logic**: Automatically scans all generated records for common IRAS rejection reasons:
    - NRIC/FIN format patterns.
    - Missing mandatory address fields (Block/House No, Type, Postal Code).
    - Basic CPF ceiling sanity checks.
- **Visual Feedback**: Employees with issues are flagged with a red ⚠️ badge. Hovering over the badge reveals the specific list of errors.

### 2. IR21 (Tax Clearance) Drafting
- **Usage**: Located in the **Cessation/IR21** tab.
- **Workflow**: For foreign employees with cessation dates, a new **📝 Draft IR21** button is available.
- **Functionality**: Aggregates all Year-To-Date (YTD) income, bonuses, and CPF contributions automatically from existing payslips, preparing the data for tax clearance filing.

### 3. One-Stop Payroll (OSP) Export
- **Usage**: Use the **📤 Export Data** dropdown.
- **Target**: Supports the One-Stop Payroll initiative format for unified government submissions.

## 🛠️ Verification Results

### Backend API Testing
We executed a high-fidelity verification script against populated payroll data (Entity 2, YA 2026):
- **Form Generation**: Successfully generated for 93 employees.
- **Validation Engine**: Detected 4 critical errors for employee `ADAIKKALAM KESAVAN` (Invalid NRIC, missing address info).
- **IR21 Drafting**: Successfully consolidated YTD data for employee `KITTAPPA SASIKUMAR`.

### Database Schema Robustness
- **Automated Migrations**: The system now self-heals by creating `iras_benefits_in_kind` and `iras_share_options` tables on boot if they are missing.
- **Constraint Handling**: Fixed NOT NULL constraint issues to ensure seamless saving of tax forms.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Integrate **CorpPass OIDC** for direct authentication.
- Implement **AIS-API 2.0 JSON** deep mapping.
- Official **IRAS SFFS Vendor Listing** preparation.
