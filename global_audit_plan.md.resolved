# Global UI/UX & Responsive Audit Plan

A comprehensive overhaul of the HRMS interface to ensure professional branding, full responsiveness, and intuitive navigation.

## Proposed Changes

### 📱 Responsive Layout & Navigation
#### [MODIFY] [Layout.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity Demos/HRMS Singapore/client/src/components/Layout.jsx)
- **Mobile Theme Toggle**: Ensure the Dark/Light mode toggle is visible in the mobile header or sidebar menu.
- **Mobile Sidebar spacing**: Refine the mobile menu spacing to be as compact as the desktop version.

### 👥 Employees Page Overhaul
#### [MODIFY] [Employees.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity Demos/HRMS Singapore/client/src/pages/Employees.jsx)
- **Visibility Fix**: Ensure the "+Add Employee" button is visible and properly aligned across all screen sizes.
- **Table Simplification**: Remove "Department", "Group", and "Nationality" columns from the main table.
- **Advanced Filtering**:
    - Implement dropdown filters for Department, Group, and Nationality above the table.
    - Ensure filters are adaptive and glassmorphism-styled.

### 🍱 Global Page Audit (Light & Dark Mode)
- **Audit & Refine**: Systematically check every page for:
    - Consistent Glassmorphism (`glass-card`, `input-glass`).
    - Proper background colors in Dark Mode (`var(--bg-main)`, `var(--bg-input)`).
    - Balanced white-space and typography.
- **Pages to Audit**:
    - Dashboard, Payroll, Attendance (Manual & Face), Leave Management, Reports.
    - All Master Data settings.

## Verification Plan

### Browser Verification (Chrome DevTools)
- Verify **iPhone 12/14 Pro** viewport for header/toggle visibility.
- Verify **iPad Pro** and **Desktop (1920x1080)** layout consistency.
- Test "Add Employee" button visibility on small screens.

### Manual Verification
- Toggle between Light and Dark modes on every page.
- Test new filters on the Employees page.
- Verify scrolling and sticky headers.
