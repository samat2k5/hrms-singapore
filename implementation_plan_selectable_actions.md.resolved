# Implementation Plan - Selectable Action Dropdowns

Replace the "Actions" floating menus with a standard `<select>`-based interaction to ensure the options are always contained within the layout flow and provide a more native "click and select" experience.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> I will be refactoring the "Actions" component across three pages. Instead of a floating menu that appears on hover/click, users will see a professional dropdown button (styled `<select>`) that triggers the action immediately upon selection.

## Proposed Changes

### [Payslip.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity Demos/HRMS Singapore/client/src/pages/Payslip.jsx)
- Replace the `dropdown` [ul](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/server/engine/iras-engine.js#6-65)/[li](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/client/src/pages/Payslip.jsx#17-586) structure with a styled `<select>` element.
- Options: "Actions" (default), "Download PDF", "Send via Email", "Share via WhatsApp".
- Trigger actions on `onChange` and reset the select to "Actions".

### [Leave.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity Demos/HRMS Singapore/client/src/pages/Leave.jsx)
- Replace the row-level `dropdown` with a `<select>` element.
- Apply consistent `h-8` or `h-10` styling.

### [EmployeeKETs.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity Demos/HRMS Singapore/client/src/pages/EmployeeKETs.jsx)
- Replace the header `dropdown` with a `<select>` element.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Navigation**: Go to Payslip, Leave Balances, and Employee KETs.
2.  **Interaction**:
    -   Click the "**Actions**" dropdown.
    -   Select "**Download PDF**". Verify the PDF download starts.
    -   Select "**Send via Email**". Verify the email intent opens.
    -   Select "**Share via WhatsApp**". Verify the WhatsApp link opens.
3.  **UI Check**:
    -   Confirm the dropdown resets to the default "**Actions**" label after a selection is made.
    -   Verify the dropdown is perfectly contained within the card/header and does not "float" over other elements in a way that causes clipping issues.
    -   Check responsiveness on mobile view.
