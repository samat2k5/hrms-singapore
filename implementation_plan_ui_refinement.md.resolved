# Implementation Plan - Unified Action Dropdowns

Consolidate "Download PDF", "Send via Email", and "Share via WhatsApp" buttons into a unified "Actions" or "Export" dropdown menu to save layout height and improve the professional aesthetic of the application.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> I will be consolidating the standalone "Download PDF" buttons into the "Transmit" dropdown, renaming it to "Actions" or "Export" to create a cleaner header row.

## Proposed Changes

### Frontend Components

#### [MODIFY] [Payslip.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity Demos/HRMS Singapore/client/src/pages/Payslip.jsx)
- Rename the "Transmit" dropdown to "📤 Actions".
- Move the "Download PDF" button inside the dropdown.
- Standardize button heights using a common utility class or specific padding.

#### [MODIFY] [Leave.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity Demos/HRMS Singapore/client/src/pages/Leave.jsx)
- Refactor the row-level action buttons for each employee.
- Combine "Transmit" and "PDF" into a single "Actions" dropdown.
- Ensure consistent height with other buttons on the page.

#### [MODIFY] [EmployeeKETs.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity Demos/HRMS Singapore/client/src/pages/EmployeeKETs.jsx)
- Consolidate the header action bar.
- Move "Download PDF" into the "Transmit/Actions" dropdown.
- Fix any height discrepancies between the "Edit", "Issue KET", and the new "Actions" dropdown.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Payslip Page**:
    -   Navigate to a payslip.
    -   Verify that only one "Actions" button is visible in the header.
    -   Ensure the dropdown contains: "Download PDF", "Send via Email", and "Share via WhatsApp".
    -   Test all three actions to ensure they still function correctly.
2.  **Leave Page**:
    -   Go to the Leave balances tab.
    -   Check the employee cards.
    -   Verify the consolidated dropdown replaces the side-by-side buttons.
    -   Confirm "PDF" and "Transmit" options work.
3.  **Employee KETs Page**:
    -   View an employee's KETs.
    -   Verify the header actions are streamlined.
    -   Test "Download PDF" and "Transmit" from the new dropdown.
4.  **Visual Audit**:
    -   Check button heights across all three pages to ensure they are visually aligned and consistent.
