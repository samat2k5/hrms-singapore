# PDF Layout & Alignment Refinement

This plan addresses visual inconsistencies and overlapping issues in generated PDF reports.

## Proposed Changes

### [MODIFY] [Payslip.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/client/src/pages/Payslip.jsx)
- Update all `autoTable` calls (Earnings, Deductions, CPF, Employer Contributions, Attendance) to include:
  - `columnStyles: { 0: { cellWidth: 140 }, 1: { cellWidth: 'auto', halign: 'right' } }`
  - This ensures standard "Description" column width and right-aligned "Amount" columns across all sections.

### [MODIFY] [EmployeeKETs.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/client/src/pages/EmployeeKETs.jsx)
- **Header Fix**: Shift header text (Employer, Employee, Issue Date) further down (starting at Y=40) to clear the logo height.
- **Top Margin**: Update `startY` for the first table to `60` instead of `50`.
- **Footer Fix**: Update `autoTable` calls to include `margin: { bottom: 30 }` to prevent overlapping with the footer branding at Y=285.

### [MODIFY] [Leave.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/client/src/pages/Leave.jsx)
- **Header Fix**: Adjust individual leave record header positioning to avoid overlapping with the logo.
- **Margins**: Add `margin: { bottom: 30 }` to all `autoTable` calls in [exportSummaryPDF](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/client/src/pages/Leave.jsx#163-232) and [exportIndividualPDF](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/client/src/pages/Leave.jsx#233-337).
- **Positioning**: Shift table `startY` down to provide more breathing room below the header.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Verification (Browser)
1. **Payslip PDF**:
   - Navigate to Payroll -> View finalized run -> Payslip.
   - Click "Export PDF".
   - Verify all table amount columns are perfectly aligned and right-justified as per the provided screenshot reference.
2. **KET PDF**:
   - Generate KET PDF and verify header text is below the logo and footer text is not cut off by tables.
3. **Leave PDF**:
   - Generate Individual Leave PDF and verify similar fixes.

### Manual Verification
- Review generated PDFs visually to ensure no new regressions in layout or data truncation.
