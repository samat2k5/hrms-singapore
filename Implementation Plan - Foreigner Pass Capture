# Implementation Plan - Foreigner Pass Capture

Add fields to capture and track Work Pass details for Foreigner employees, improving Singapore compliance and record-keeping.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] Database

#### [MODIFY] [init.js](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/server/db/init.js)
- Add migration to include `work_pass_type` (TEXT) and `work_pass_expiry` (DATE) to the `employees` table.

### [Component Name] Backend API

#### [MODIFY] [employees.js](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/server/routes/employees.js)
- Update `POST /api/employees` and `PUT /api/employees/:id` to handle `work_pass_type` and `work_pass_expiry`.

### [Component Name] Frontend

#### [MODIFY] [EmployeeForm.jsx](file:///c:/Users/mathi/Desktop/AntiGravity%20Demos/HRMS%20Singapore/client/src/pages/EmployeeForm.jsx)
- Update `emptyEmployee` state with new fields.
- Add conditional fields for "Work Pass Type" and "Work Pass Expiry" when `nationality === 'Foreigner'`.
- Pass new fields to the API via `FormData`.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  Open the **Employee Form** (Add New).
2.  Set **Nationality** to "Foreigner".
3.  Verify that "Work Pass Type" (Dropdown) and "Work Pass Expiry" (DatePicker) fields appear.
4.  Fill in the details and save the employee.
5.  Re-open the employee for editing and verify the details are persisted.
6.  Change nationality to "Singapore Citizen" and verify the fields are hidden.
